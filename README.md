## Project Overview

The application presents an example book store, which is designed to show the entire shopping process. The application consists of 4 subpages.
1. Home
- downloading data from Firebase after entering the application page
- displaying previously downloaded data in a specific format, i.e. each book contains the cover, its title, author, number of pages, and two buttons:
  - ADD TO CART, which will add a specific item to the cart,
   - ORDER, which will direct you to the stage of completing the form
- in the header, there is a search engine (after the title or author of the book) and a tag how many books are in the basket

2. Shopping cart page
- displaying a list of books selected by the user,
- the ability to increase the number of books or delete the entire item,
- the NEXT button, which will direct you to the stage of completing the form

3. Form page
- preparation of the form
- using template-driven when working with a form,
- the SUMMARY button, which will direct you to the order summary stage
